27.	Calendar Generator:
Build a program that generates a monthly calendar for a specified year and month. Use loops to iterate through the days of the week and the days of the month. Allow the user to input the year and month.
28.	Simple Inventory System:
Build a basic inventory management system where users can add, remove, and view items in their inventory. Utilize loops to handle user interactions and keep the program running until the user decides to exit.
29.	To-Do List Manager: Implement a simple to-do list manager where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Utilize loops to repeatedly present the menu and handle user interactions until they choose to exit.
30.	Pattern Recognition in Text: Develop a program that takes a text input and identifies patterns such as repeated words, palindromes, or specific sequences. Use loops to analyze the text and provide relevant information.
