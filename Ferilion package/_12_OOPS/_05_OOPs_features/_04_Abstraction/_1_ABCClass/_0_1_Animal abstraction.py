Employee has Address:

               Address
               
CurrentAddress     PermAddress        OfficeAddress

class Employee:
    int eid;
    float sal;
    Address addr;
    

Why Abstraction is required ?

SC: Each sub class wants their own body uniquely.

                           Animal
                                eating()    # Why should i provide body here ?
                                   
                  Cat          Dog       Tiger      Lion

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):   # Abstract class

    @abstractmethod
    def eating(self):   # abstract method : Incomplete method / Method without body
        pass

class Cat(Animal):
    def eating(self):
        print("Cat eating()")

cat = Cat()
cat.eating()



'''
Here all sub classes of Animal,inherits eating() and running() AS IS, 
but sleeping() method is required for all sub classes, at the same time need to be implemeneted uniquely.

An Abstract class can have 
    - All Concrete Methods   : Class 
    - All Abstract Methods   : Interface
    - Combination of Concrete+Abstract Methods : Abstract Class
