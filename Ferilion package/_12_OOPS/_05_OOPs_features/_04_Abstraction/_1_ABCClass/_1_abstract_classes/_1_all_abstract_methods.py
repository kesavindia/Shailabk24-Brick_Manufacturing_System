4. ABSTRACTION :
===================
Hiding the implementation details i.e, method body wrt Inhertiance
Super class can be : 
        Class         : When sub classes need reusable components
                      : 0% abstraction
        Abstract Class: When sub class requires only signature
                            1. With all concrete methods : 0% abstraction
                            2. With all abstract methods : 100% abstraction
                            3. Both abstract,concrete
                                    1 concrete, 2 abstract methods: 66.6666%  
                                    2 concrete, 2 abstract methods : 50%  
                             
        Interface     : All abstract methods : 100% abstraction 


Inheritance: Super class Sub class
           : When all sub classes has common features ==> Define Methods Super class with body
		   : When all sub classes has unique implementation ==> 
		               - Make class as Abstract class(super class)
		               - Define abstract methods* in super class
Abstraction : 0 to 100%
0%   -- In super abstract class,all are concrete methods      define - Class
30%  -- 10 methods - 3 abstract methods + 7 concrete methods  define - Abstract Class
100% -- In super abstract class, all are abstract methods     define - Interface

High level module:  PlaceOrder
Abstraction:  DeliveryAddress
Low level module : HomeAddress, OfficeAddress

DIP(Dependency Inversion Principle): 
- High level, Low level modules should not direclty depend on each other
- Both should have abstraction(medium)

IOC Design Pattern: 
--------------------
    - At runtime based on user selection from UI 
        dependency will be injected automtically 
        DeliveryAddress da = OfficeAddress()
        Animal a = Tiger()
        Animal a = Monkey()
        

Open Closed Principle:
------------------------
- Open for Extension: add one more animal Monkey 
- Closed for Modification: dont disturb  Highlevel or Medium
