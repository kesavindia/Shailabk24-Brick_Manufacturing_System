As a sub class you can reuse super class methods  AS IS 
  OR
Override super class methods
 BUT 
Dont create your own methods in sub class

    Why should I override ?
    Java: Specification/Protocol
    
        SuperClass:
        -------------
        As a super class I am providing the methods as per req.
            - As a sub class listen to me
                - Either reuse methods AS IS through Inheritance
                - Or override methods and provide your own body 
                        - BUT Dont create your own methods.

SUPER CLASS:
============
As a sub class, use my super class methods AS IS   (or) 
                                           Override my super class method
                        but don't write your own methods

   - If we create our own methods in subclass : USELESS 
   - It means that, either use super class method 
                     AS IS or  Override it 
                but dont create your own methods in sub class
