METHOD_OVERRIDING_ = ''' OVERRIDE *

II: All sub classes required  : a. Common  signature      but 
                                b. Unique implementation

                            --> method signature -  common behavior  
                            --> method body      -  unique** implementation 


   If we write classes without inheritance as below,
                 Tiger   		Lion        Cat        Dog
					 eating()    ate()    i_am_eating()   we_ate()

	We cant understand common behavior. 
	So this will not work out.
   
   Behavior : Signature
   Implement/Implementation: Providing Body 
   
    ==> We have to use inheritance mechanism here 
    
								Animal
									def eating():
									    body

                Tiger   		Lion        Cat        Dog
					 eating()    eating()    eating()   eating()
                        ownbody     ownbody      ownbody   ownbody
                        
Above mechanism is called as Method Overriding ***
